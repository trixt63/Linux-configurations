My dot files. Most of these are supposed to be in ~/ <br>
Contains:
- *```xkbcomp```* folder: to remap the keyboard layout under X11.
- ```.imwheel```: config for **Imwheel** to speedup the scroll speed.
- ```.ideavim```: config for the IdeaVim extension in Intellij IDEs.

<br>The following configs should not be used, or you should config from scratch. I just put them here as backup.
- ```.Xmodmap```: I use **xkbcomp** now.
- The usual dots ```.bashrc```, ```.bash_aliases``` and ```profile```: should not be used, as I use fish shell now. Should use the configs in the *config* folder instead.
- ```.gitconfig```: config for git
