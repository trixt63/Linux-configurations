# Linux-customization

This is the repository for my Linux desktop customization.

## Items:
1. **conky**
- Put the content of this folder to ~/.conky.
- Installation of conky-manager2 is advised.
2. **fonts**, **icons**, **themes**, **backgrounds**
- Put the content to the respective folders in ```~/.local/share/``` (i.e ```.local/share/fonts```, ```.local/share/icons```,...)
- You can also make them hidden (put "." in front of the name) and put them to the home folder.
- For global use, put to /usr/share/ instead.
3. **xfce4-panel-profiles**
- Put the content to the respective folder in ```~/.local/share/```
- Installation of *xfce4-panel-profiles* package is recommended.
